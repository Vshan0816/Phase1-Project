# Melty Blood Type Lumina Frame Data App

## Description

Melty Blood Type Lumina Frame Data App is a JavaScript application that manipulates DOM elements dynamically and gathers information from a self built API. I built this project because I'm passionate about fighting games, and Melty Blood Type Lumina is the most recent one I played. The purpose of this website, is to gather specific information about the characters that will contribute to deeper understanding of the game for the player.

## Usage

To get started type `json-server --watch db.json` in the terminal to spin up the server and `open index.html`(for macs) or `explorer.exe index.html` (for windows). The web app will load a character images, and you can click on them for further information including a table of their complete moveset and frame data. There is also a form where if you type in a specific move name, with a character prefix, you can access the frame data of the move you entered. The information of each move that is entered is added to a list, which you can use to compare information and clear it with a button.
